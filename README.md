# FIT3140 Assignment 4. Team 29.

## Project Description ##
In this project, we will conduct two spikes to determine the best data structure for morse code decoder. The first spike examines the execution time of decoding incoming message by storing and receiving the code of each letter as a string, while the second spike examines the execution time of decoding incoming message by storing and receiving the code of each letter as a list of characters.

## Run the program ##
Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIT3140-S1-2017/assignment-4-team29
cd assignment-4-team29
```

Continue using 'cd' to move into any one of the spikes' directories.

Type the following to run two spikes separately.
```bash
node Spike.js
```
The morse code letter will be printed out if there is a match between randomly generated data and a pre-stored morse code table array, null otherwise. The average execution time, longest exection time, shortest exection time of a number of tests will be printed out too.
